# Draw planets in the background

For now only use static/assets/planets/sun.png (no need to overcomplicate things yet)

StarBackground.js is an example of how it was done for stars.

the goal is to start making the background prettier.

# Organize files

It would be nice to have the levels and its dialogue be in their own folders.
maybe in the beginning we can try

levels/
    level_1
    level_2
    level_3

# Add more places to clean piss

Make it so there are multiple piles of piss around the galaxy.
Currently MainLevel takes care of this.

Find a good solution.
