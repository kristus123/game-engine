# Ideas to implement

## Lore

**NB! This universe takes place in the DongMan / Schlongman / DongMaster / Schlongdongman / DongMaster universe, which is not a universe that is politically correct nor does it represent the opinions or values of the creators of this universe.**

This game takes place after the occurrences of the first 7 movies, meaning the world has already been taken over by women and most of the story of DongMaster has taken place. The whereabouts of DongMaster is currently unknown.

Elon Musk shot up rockets in secrecy, hoping to save as many of his fellow men.
Technology in space has evolved at a pace similar to the Personal computers once did back on earth.

Once you go to space there is no way of communicating with the world as MuskNet (Also known as StarLink) is the only available internet provider in space.
The state of Earth is none the less in a bad state, as by simply looking down on the blue planet you will see nuclear bombs are firing on a dailybasis.

Elon Musk knew about DongMaster, and helped him with his DongTech.
In return Elon got to place a Chip inside of DongMaster's head, in hopes that DongMaster Would be the first to survive the implant.

Elon might be the key to find DongMaster

## Draft

Various ideas discussed:

- Pirate-inspired thoughts for the game.
- Consideration of halshugging (decapitation) in the medieval context.
- Introduction of the term "keelhaul" for a pirate-themed element.
- Discussion of spacevikings as a concept.
- Mention of "blood eagle," a brutal Viking ritual involving ribcage removal.
- Inclusion of the feudal political system in the game.
- Pyramid system explanation, involving kings, vassals, and their own subordinates.
- Addition of elements like caste system, racism, and segregation.
- Reference to India's historical caste system and feudal-like structure.
- Proposal to incorporate plundering and politics as central themes.
- Suggestion to include different races in the game.
- Proposal to create individual villages or planets as part of the game.
- Expansion of gameplay to include businesses, factories, and economic aspects.
- Idea to allow players to create their own bases or planets.
- Introduction of an editor and tools to involve friends in the game development process.
- Concept of floating bases in space, resembling the game "Rust."
- for eksempel om en karakter blir skadet og du har komt langt i spillet kan du lage forskjellige typer prostetics osv
- en annen ting eg tenkte litt på når det kommer til lore, i lethal company e det egt ikkje noe særlig lore som e viktig, men for de som e interessert kan man gå rundt på maps å lete etter "notater" fra en scientist eller scanne monstre så får man opp info om de skrevet av denne scientisten (unveil dongmaster)
