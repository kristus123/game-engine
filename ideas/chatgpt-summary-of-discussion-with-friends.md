# Introduction:

Embark on a journey through the vast expanse of space in "Cosmic Choices," a game that offers a unique blend of exploration, strategy, and moral decisions. As you traverse the cosmos, encountering diverse factions, dangerous pirates, and mysterious phenomena, you must navigate the intricacies of a complex universe. The game introduces an inventory system, allowing players to manage various cargo items, each with its own set of consequences.

# Early Gameplay:

Upon starting the game, players find themselves in a bustling cosmic hub. The narrative kicks off with a visit to the local grocery store or gas station. Early choices include whether to help individuals in need or strictly follow orders. A map reveals nearby locations, such as a space gas station, offering options to either steal a motorbike or explore job opportunities on a centralized job board.

# Job Opportunities and Business Ventures:
The job board presents a plethora of opportunities, ranging from traditional roles like pizza delivery to more unconventional ones, including participating in a Purge circle or engaging in tile pizza delivery. Players can also establish their businesses, such as pizza delivery services, drop shipping, elder care, or even manufacturing. Factional dynamics and rivalries add complexity, with the option to engage in sabotage or choose a more peaceful path.

# Moral Dilemmas and Storyline:

Similar to "Papers, Please," players face moral dilemmas, such as deciding who lives or dies in a resource-scarce environment. The overarching mystery of why humanity is in space unravels gradually, prompting players to investigate and unveil the truth behind the myths surrounding their existence. The game introduces a shady hospital and the concept of harvesting individuals in cryopods.

# Political Intrigues and Faction Relationships:

Borders and politics play a crucial role, influencing fluctuating prices and requiring adaptability in cargo delivery. Factions, both allies and adversaries, engage in constant struggles for power. The absorption of smaller factions by larger ones triggers intrigue and potential retaliation. The player's choice of faction alignment impacts the game's progression and outcomes.

# Illegal Activities and Threats:

Engaging in illegal cargo activities heightens the risk, making it harder to cross borders. The presence of pirates in Faction-less areas adds danger to the journey. The game encourages players to explore moons and avoid planets due to restrictions.

# Empire Building and Freedom of Choice:

Players have the freedom to choose their path, whether it's growing a powerful empire, leading a relaxed life, or simply delivering pizzas. The game emphasizes the impact of choices on personal and galactic scales, allowing for a diverse range of experiences.

# Orphan Storyline:

The game explores the harsh reality of orphans left in the care of factions due to their parents' inability to provide. Players witness the struggles of these orphans, hoping for reunion with their parents one day. The narrative delves into the complexities of socioeconomic disparities and the emotional toll on families separated by circumstances.

# Conclusion:

"Cosmic Choices" invites players to navigate a rich and multifaceted universe, offering a blend of strategy, morality, and narrative depth. As you make decisions that shape your journey, the game challenges you to confront the mysteries of space, political intrigues, and the moral fabric of society. The cosmos awaits, with every choice echoing through the galaxies.
