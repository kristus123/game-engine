The game we will make will be a simple prototype.

You walk around as a farmer.
You pick up chicken eggs (because the chickens randomly drop eggs)

There are many chickens roaming around.

You can shoot the chickens and pick up their meat.


What is needed for this?


- old_man.png can be used as player character
- sword_on_table.png can be used as placeholder for picking up rifle to shoot chickens
- there is a chicken.js class which can be used for chickens
