In MainLevel, i want to make it so there are multiple piles of piss around the galaxy.

This means the code needs to be changed a little.

I also want to take advantage of:

```
Draw.objectThatIsMovingInRectangularPathAroundObject(player, position)
```

To guide the player to the next pile of piss when he is driving his spaceship.
