## Coding conventions

- Imports are added automatically so you don't need to import stuff, also it will crash if you include imports within `static/`
- In every file, you can export one thing, and that one thing should have the same name as the file
- ´./lint.sh´ will take care of the code convention

## First time set up

```
npm install
```

## run locally

```
npm run start
```
